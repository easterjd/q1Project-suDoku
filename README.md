## ABOUT
I've always loved puzzle-type games and SuDoku is no different. SuDoku is something that's very special to me as it's been an amazing tool not only to relax when I'm stressed out out also challenge me when I'm bored.

I wanted to create a new SuDoku game because--since it has filled up such a great space in my life--I wanted to create a game platform that reflected a little bit about who I am as well.
